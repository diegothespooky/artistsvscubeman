MonoColor - 60
four kingdoms
the last flight home
rising sun
the lonely boy revenge
locked outside
flying free
antipathetic child
return of the last serpent
the last shadow of the tree
the lack of smileyness
fitting in
the story of two towns
my last tortilla 
passed out man
our last handshake
our last hug
brus li
cow caine
half hot dog
everytime i see you
how much i care
the binary messiah
the hyptnotizer dream
the extenuation
restless
the hypnotizer nightmare
broken trashcan
so close yet so far
do not open
melting moon
the devils trident
here i am
my last sight
fire dreams
telling time
breaking the habit
fixing what is not broken
looking at the sky
i guess it was the last zombie
gliding away
a circular reeducation
knee ability
the lsat day of reabiit season
the death of me 
caffeine
coffee break
the human trust
spikey's waking
the dark sprite
the summoner rift
colorfur panda
unknown fellah
no time to lose
fast and furious
mind glow
the mind concept of prohibition
the self isolation
not the same
patience
insomnia

bicolor
bipolar disorder
understanding
missing you
spring
just hug me
life is good
you and i collide
kiss me
second day of spring
good job pal
life as a cycle
aiming
die standing up
suck it
my crash
dual concatenation
observing
eternity
ma home
sweetness
